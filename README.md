# React + JSX w/ ES6 transforms + CJSX for Meteor

This is a simple package that adds React (with addons), along with JSX and CJSX (coffeescript JSX) transpilers.

This package takes **no** position on *how* to integrate Meteor and React, although it still works with the default [react-meteor-data](http://react-in-meteor.readthedocs.org/en/latest/meteor-data/) package if you add it yourself.
